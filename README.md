"Diamond Insights" is a project that focuses on analyzing and visualizing data related to the diamond industry. The project aims to uncover insights into various aspects of the diamond industry, such as production, pricing, and demand.

The project will involve data collection from various sources such as diamond industry reports and market analysis, and data preprocessing techniques such as cleaning, filtering, and feature engineering will be applied to the collected data. The selected features will be used to create various visualizations, such as scatter plots, heat maps, and histograms.

The project aims to provide valuable insights into the diamond industry, such as identifying trends in diamond production and pricing, understanding consumer preferences and demands, and identifying potential growth opportunities in the market. It can be useful for diamond producers, traders, investors, and consumers in making informed decisions about diamond-related investments and purchases.
